# *capsense+fsr* project

This is the main arduino's project inside *das KÃ¶rperrauchen* project.
This program runs on micro's boards and scan both capacitive and resistive sensors.
The sensor values are sent through serial interface over USB in OSC slip-encoded packets.
Many parameters of the boards can be set through OSC too.
